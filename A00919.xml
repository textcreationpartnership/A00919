            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

You might haue bene thought wyſe yf you had houlden your peace. For men of your ſorte, hauing a negatiue religion, are commonly ſatisfyed to carpe at our ſayings, without care to iuſtifie their owne, and but by extremitie, to ſpecifie any poſitiue doctrin, that they may haue libertie to change at will. But you would be a more venturouſe Caualiero then the reſidue: let all the world iudge, whether it was for any extraordinarie wyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie, if you, who among thowſands were moſt vnfit, haue profeſſed playne decretal poſitions, repugnant not only to all chriſtianitie, but (which ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily by you is more esteemed) to all your owne confraternie; or rather (becauſe you continualy iarr) to your confederated diuerſitie. So that many of your moſt iudicious ſurmiſers miſtruſt, that by ſome promiſed promotion of papiſts, you had praeiudiced, and in a maner betrayed your profeſsion to infamie, and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, &amp; of ſett purpoſe, by ſo diſcouering many defectiue articles, and enorme abſurdities therof, which to our owne contryes can not chooſe but cauſe à diſlyke, yf not a loathſomnes, and ſurfet, and being notifyed to other contryes, (which had bene done, yf I had not altered my purpoſe only for better concealing for what friuolous futilities the Catholick fayth in Christ Ieſus is exchanged, by wryting in our vulgar toung, what I first intended to haue written in latin)
<pb facs="tcp:2419:14"/>
would produce in them ether a diſdayne toward vs, or deploration againſt our eſtate, that ſo many good diſpoſitions, and otherwyſe deepe capacities, are ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably miſcaryed by ſo baſe, and deceitfull deluſions, palpablie perceauable euen to winking eyes. I aſſure you no mans death I know, had bene vnto me more vnwished before this my awnſwer published, leaſt it had bene ſuſpected, or excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that I had impoſed your owne printed aſſertions, vpon your profeſsion. But my ſynceritie will appeare perſpicuouſly, by inſerting your booke intirely, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordantly to your <hi>Dublinian</hi> edition; which can not be imagined to haue bene a deede of any other then your ſelfe. You haue great and ſundrie cauſes to be thankfull for this my awnſwer. First, becauſe it diſplayeth ſeueral dangerouſe errours, by which you would haue eternally perished, and now by reclayming them, yf you pleaſe, you may eſcape. Secondly, that by it the sharper reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and refutation of others who would and might more diſdaynfully reproue you, is perhapp anticipated, and hindred. Thirdly, that for ſparing fauor toward you, many ſlips are indulgently diſſembled, and ſuch as are detected, in the moſt milde ſtyle that might poſsiblie belong to maters of lyke qualitie, are proſecuted. I cowld calculate others, yf I attended deſerued gratitude in one of your diſpoſition, or education. Howſoeuer you will interpret kinde and beneficious offices, I will inceſſantly implore Gods infinit mercie toward you, and your complices, that he would open your obſtinat eyes, and mollifie your hardned harts, and mitigat his incenſed wrath against you: wherby you may vnderstand your errours, abandon your hereſies, ceaſe to diuide the Churche and ſcattre Chriſts Catholick flock, being by ſo pretious redemption formerly vnited; And finaly, that being myndfull whence you are fallen, you repent, and returne to your firſt workes, leaſt your candlestyke be remoued, and for want of true light, fall into that infidelitie of all Christian religion, which in <hi>Africk, Grece,</hi> and other places, immediatly ſucceded opinions begon, and ſtifflye retrayned, againſt the Apoſtolick, Romain, and Catholick beleefe.

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS Diſputation was occaſioned the 29. of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember 1600. by means of <hi>M. VVilliam Nugent</hi> (an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable, and learned Eſquyer) at the table of <hi>M. Ihon Rider</hi> (tearmed Deane of <hi>S. Patricks</hi>): The ſayd <hi>M. Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,</hi> maintayning, no diuerſitie of beleefe, or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to be betwixt the Catholicks of theſe tymes, and the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Catholicks of the tymes of the Apoſtles. Contrarie to which aſſertion, the forſayd <hi>M. Rider</hi> affirmed, that the difference was as great, as betwixt Proteſtancye, and Papiſtrie; becauſe the firſt Catholicks, by his ſaying, had bene Proteſtants. Vpon theſe two ſeueral affirmations, they both agreed to abyde a lawfull reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the learned: whiche yf it should iuſtifie <hi>M. Nugents</hi> perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, then <hi>M. Rider</hi> would recant. Yf it could not; then <hi>M. Nugent</hi> would become a Proteſtant.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To haue the forſayd reſolution, a counterfet letter, as from doubtfull Catholicks toward ſix articles therin ſpecifyed, was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to all Prieſts, Ieſuits, &amp; Seminariſts, bearing date the 21. of October 1600. by way of prouocation, requyring them to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer therto, <hi>as they te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred the credit of their Religon, the conuincing of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and the ſatisfying of poore conſciences:</hi> which aunſwer was to be exhibited, <hi>within three monethes next inſuing.</hi> To be briefe; It was partly referred, and partly impoſed, that I should decide this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie; as well as one (in priſon, ſequeſtred from all communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of my brethren, and diuers otherwayes diſabled, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred) of my ſlender capacitie; in ſo short a tyme, might accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I hauing accordingly diſpatched briefe collections of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, Fathers, and euidences of moſt principal Proteſtants, as well of England, as of other Contryes, and obſerued ſuch ordre as from tyme to tyme I layd open befor all behoulders, their eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent demonſtrations, that the cauſe of <hi>M. Nugent</hi> was iuſt, and the contrary altogether vntrue: I ſent them the 2. day of Ianuarie, in the name of Catholick preiſts of Irla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, by my coſen <hi>M. Michael

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Great contentment was diſſembled at the ſight of our aunſwer, great thanks, great promiſes to replye with lyke expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. The 6. of Ian. he repayred to me, in the Caſtle, applauding to the forſayd aunſwer, that it was beyond his expectation. Yet that he would reioyne therto, yf it might be approued by my name, and ſubſcription. I miſtruſting badd meaſure by ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, remayned ſlack to condiſcend therto. Manifowld prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations were made, as alſo in his letter to that effect, of great goodwill to pleaſure and benifit, and no intention to indomage therby. Vpon which flattring, but eſpecialy to honour my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uioure Ieſus Chriſt, and his inuincible Church, I gratifyed him with my approbation, and ſubſcription, not fearing death or danger for my Profeſſion.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Notwithſtanding his former promiſe of expedition, in three monethes almoſt thriſe trypled, appeared noe replye to ſuche our aunſwer. Alſo contrary to his promiſe, he published his replye the 28. of September 1602. Befor euer he had acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me therwith; that I might not haue had in redines my aunſuer to confront it. When at laſt euery extended hand, yea many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyding hands were filled with his replye vnder the name of <hi>Caueat,</hi> then in that liberal dole, I alſo was preſented with one copie. Wherat conſidering the tenoure therof, I ſtoode amazed (as <hi>Polidor virgil</hi> ſayth of him ſelfe, when he beheld the hiſtorie of <hi>Hector Boethius</hi>) lyke one that had ſeene a beare whelping. In fyne, I aduertiſed him ſelfe, within 48. howers that yf he would aduenture to purchaſe me libertie of books, a cleark to ingroſſe my wrytings, and communication with my brethren, I would ioyne iſſue with him, euen before the right honorable Deputie and Counceil; yea alſo before his owne pew-fellowes of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege: that yf I did not conuince ſuche his Caueat to be frawghted and intirely replenished, with falſifications, deprauations, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, gnorance, and impietie; I would abyde any their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie appointed penaltie, and punishment whatſoeuer.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. This sharpe admonition vrged him, (as I deſired and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceaued) to propounde the ſute to the State. They of their bountie accorded, that at his diſcretion, books, acceſſe, and printe should be allowed me. Books I confeſse to haue had curteouſly, from the College.

So that what eating and drinking is to the bodie, that beleeuing is to the ſoule. And as bread and fleſh be meat corporall for the bodie; ſo Chriſt our bread is made ſpirituall for the ſoule. And as corporall meats are taken with the corporall mouth, ſo are ſpirituall meates (Chriſt crucified with all his benefits) receiued with faith, the mouth of the ſoule. And therefore to teach all poſterities how to expound theſe words of Chriſt, hee giues a generall rule perpetually to be obſerued in GODS church: Saying:<note n="(a)" place="margin">De doct.

To eate corporallie, reallie, and ſubſtantiallie Chriſts fleſh with our material mouths, and to drinke his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, ſubſtantiall, reall bloud with our bodilie lips, is a horrible thing. Therefore Chriſts words bee figuratiue. So that by <hi>Augustines</hi> owne words your litterall ſence &amp; carnall preſence is wicked and horrible, howſoeuer you cloake it with fained titles, to blinde the eies and deceiue the hearts of ſimple Catholiques.</p>
                     <p>And if you would but read the fifth chapter of the foreſaid booke; you ſhould ſee his Chriſtian caueat he giues to Gods Church touching this point. <hi>In principio cauendu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſt ne figurata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> locutione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ad littera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> accipias, &amp;c. Firſt of all, you muſt beware that you take not a figuratiue ſpeech according to the letter:</hi> his reaſon followes, <hi>for the letter,</hi> (that is, the litterall ſence) <hi>killeth. But the ſpirit,</hi> that is, the ſpirituall ſence) <hi>giueth life. For when we take the figuratiue ſpeech for a proper ſpeech, we make the ſence carnall, neither is there anie thing more fitlie calld the death of the ſoule.</hi>

                     <p>Whoſoeuer teacheth that there is a carnall reall preſence of Chriſt in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament before conſecration, is a lyer, a deprauer of the truth, and a deceiuer of the people. But ſome late Popes, the new church of Rome,<note place="margin">This is vnaunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</note> with the colledge of Cardinals, new created Ieſuits, Semynaries, and all the Romiſh Prieſts now in Ireland teach, that there is a carnall reall preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament before conſecration.</p>
                     <p>Therefore ſome late Popes, the new Church of Rome, with the colledge of Cardinals, new created Ieſuits, Semynaries, and all the Romane Prieſts now in Ireland be lyers deprauers of the trueth, and deceiuers of the people. The maior or firſt propoſition is your owne doctrine: for you teach that before <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum</hi> be pronounced, there is no conſecration. The aſſumption or later propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is as cleere, for you perſwade the ſimple people to beleeue that theſe texts out of the ſixth of <hi>Iohn</hi> prooue a carnall preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament, a yeare before <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum</hi> was by Chriſt pronounced, or the Sacrament by Chriſt inſtituted. Therefore the concluſion, that you be lyers and deceiuers of the people, is ineuitable.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Catholiques of this kingdome by the rules of your owne religion you haue deceiued, in teaching Chriſtes carnall preſence in the Sacrament, a yeare before either Sacrament or conſecration in the Sacrament, were inſtituted.

So the Sacrament of faith (or Baptiſme) is faith.

For they preached oft, yet made not all hearers to ether receaue our Saluiour into hart, or harborow, no not in Bethſaida, or Corozain, wher he him ſelf preached moſt vſualy; nor much leſſe at his preaching did make them to be true beleeuers. Yf therfor none can receaue the ſacraments but by faith, as you ſay; and yet that by a Puritan ſermon ther is more good, and proffit attayned, then by the ſacraments; to my ſlender capacitie, Puritan ſermons are implyed to make all hearers faithfull; conſidering that ſacraments, of leſſe worth, (by your ſurmiſes) then ſuch ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons make all receauers to be faithfull; as being receaued by no others.

And this ſort holds that it is <hi>(credibile)</hi> credible, that Chriſt firſt deliuered the bread, and then conſecrated the bread, which things make your fingring and blowing vpon or ouer the bread more palpable, becauſe one muſt hold the Elements while you enchaunte them, rather then conſecrate them. The third opinion croſſeth both the other, which is, that Chriſt conſecrated <hi>virtute diuina</hi> by his diuine vertue, and afterward laid downe for poſterities a forme, after which they ſhould bleſſe or conſecrate.</p>
                     <p>Thus there were three ſeuerall opinions that this Pope ſpake of, yet it ſeemeth he liked but one of them, which was the ſecond, which he ſemeth to iuſtifie in the chapter following.</p>

Now the true Apoſtolicall conſecration is this, when the elements of bread and wine are ſet apart from their common vſe, and applied to a holie vſe, according to Gods word.</p>

                     <p>The third Pope muſt not be differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in this point, yf it were he that hacthed it. For yf he hold in this, other then we hould, he could not be authour of this that we hould. Marry <hi>Innocentius</hi> in dede telleth ther are three general ſentences in this mater: to witt of ſome, that would haue conſecration begon at the word <hi>Bleſſed;</hi> of others, that after; of diuers, that <hi>Christ</hi> conſecrated by diuine vertue, &amp; left a forme to conſecrat for poſteritie. Of theſe the two firſt differr not otherwyſe in the point of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecration, but that one telleth it was begon in the firſt woords; the other that ſuch woords were rather a preparation, then conſummation, of it. I ſhould thinke theſe two not to differr ſo muche, as yf one would ſay: you M. <hi>Rider</hi> came from your father; &amp; the other: that you came from your grandfather. For all difference alleaged is of leſſe diuerſitie, as being of what is beleeued to be the ſame ſubſtance, wheras you are of diſtinct ſubſtance, yea &amp; ſtate, as you came from your grandfather, and father. Your ſchoole point, being the firſt and laſt ſauoring any ſmack in logick, (for only two grammarian ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>cum multis alijs: à tribus ad centum,</hi> were hetherto heard of) it alſo
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:2419:77"/>
bewrayeth the authoure (by being not apliable to an argument of authoritie, but only of Maxims, or grounds) to be voyd of skill.</p>
                     <p>The arguments or ſchoole points to ſupporte any authoritie,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> according to <hi>Aristotle</hi> are only,<note place="margin">Ariſt. <hi>2.</hi> Top.</note> two: 1. <hi>In vſu verborum, ſequenda est vulgi conſuetudo:</hi> 2. <hi>In ſententia de rebus ferenda, iudicium ſapientium. In vſe of woords, the cuſtome is to be followed. In ſenſe of things, the iudgement of the wyſe, is to be imbraced.</hi> Your additions to the ſecond opinion are more remote from ſinceritie, then your former ſchoole point, from ſubtilitie. The text of <hi>Innocent</hi> hath thus. <hi>Nec etiam est credibile, quod prius dederit quàm conſecerit; Nether alſo is it credibile that he gaue firſt befor he had accomplished:</hi> Which being a palpable negation, in playneſt tearmes as euery halfe peny ſcholer may conceaue; M. <hi>Rider</hi> ether for want of skill, or for want of fidelitie, maketh it an affirmation. Verilye, this ignorance or iugling deſerueth at leaſt to haue your hoode (in the ſchole lane) pull'd ouer your head. I know not what ſhould torment his mynde in the third ſentence, vnleſſe it be, that diuine vertue is aſſcribed to Chriſt: or, that he had left vs a forme to conſecrat: which two in Gods woord, and godly mynds, are vndoubted; although in proteſtancie, Chriſt is ſayd to haue had no more diuine vertue, then <hi>Socrates,</hi> or <hi>Triſmegiſtus.</hi> ſee in our 24. numbre. As litle do I know, what he may cauill at, in the next opinion, of the maſter of Sentences; (reporting it truely without his owne commixtions) as but only telling, for compleat, and prefect conſecration, (not only for the eſſential, but alſo for the ceremonial, and hiſtorical part,) all that is preſcribed by the Church, to be obſerued. By all which accuſations examined, they being ſo idle, ſo confuſed, and intricat, as wanting, all method, and mater, and ſo remote from diſproueing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecration, as they all are confeſſed (being diſputations, not whether ther be any conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but ſuch preſuppoſed to be vndoubtfull, in what ſorte ther is any) to approue it, and withal ſo vntruely reported; all men, frends, and foes, to our profeſsion, may perceaue, that nether late, or owld, true, or falſe, ſetled beleefe, or opiniatiue diſputations, do contradict our perſuaſion: and, that diuerſitie, can not, or hath not bene among vs, in any other ſorte, then by their impudent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte, who with ſquinted eyes, and dazeled brayns behould vs; therby thinking, like gogle-eyed dronkards, euery candle to be twentie.</p>

It teacheth a new conception of Chriſt to bee made of bread by a ſinfull prieſt, and euery day, &amp; in euery place where it pleaſeth the prieſt, contrarie to the Article of our faith: which is, that Chriſt was conceaued by the holie Ghoſt, and borne of the bleſſed virgin, and but once: for ſuch Chriſt as you tender to the poore ignorant Catholickes is not a true Chriſt, neither can be, for manie reſpects, whiche are before in the beginning alleadged. Secondlie if Chriſt be in the Sacrament, he is not then aſcended, and ſo there is another article of our faith deſtroyed by this damnable fable. And thirdlie, if hee be couchant or dormant in the pixe, then the Scriptures deceiue vs, in telling vs hee ſhall come from heauen to iudge bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if your doctrine were true, Chriſt ſhould haue eaten himſelfe corporally, but you confeſſe he did eat himſelfe<note n="(a)" place="margin">Ioſephus Angles pag. c. <hi>110. 4</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſione ſecunda.</note> ſpiritually. If your doctrine of tranſubſtantiation were true, then the Lords ſupper were no Sacrament, and the reaſon is this, for euery Sacrament conſiſteth of the outward ſigne and the inward thing ſignified, and they muſt both ſtill remaine during the outward action of the Sacrament. Now if bread which is the viſible outward part of the Sacrament be changed into Chriſts bodie, then there is no Sacrament, becauſe there remaines but one part of the Sacrament, which is the thing ſignified, and then you vtterlie
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:2419:82"/>
deceiue the people, which tell them it is the Sacrament of the Altar, when it is no Sacrament at all. Againe, another abſurditie followes vppon it: for if the ſubſtance of bread be changed, then there is no proportion or analogie betwixt the ſigne and the thing ſignified, becauſe accidents cannot nouriſh. For the likeneſſe or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance betwixt bread and Chriſt, conſiſteth chieflie in this, that as bread nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth the bodie, ſo Chriſts body crucified nouriſheth the ſoule: but if the ſubſtance of bread be changed into another ſubſtance, then the proportion and propertie, is ſo changed, that it muſt ceaſe to be the thing for which it was firſt ordained and ſo the beſt you would make of the Sacrament is but a ſhaddow without a ſubſtance.</p>
                     <p>Another vnreaſonable abſurditie will follow, that Chriſt hath two bodies, one of bread made by the Prieſt, another of the bleſſed virgin conceiued by the holie Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>Againe, if his owne bodie ſhall be in manie places at once, that is contrarie to a naturall bodie, and is as voyd of learning, as the other of religion: and by this your new thirtheenth Article of your new faith, you would maintaine the being of qualities without a ſubiect, and the being of quantities without a ſubſtance, which both are impoſſible. But Becauſe the opinion is falſe and forged, without Scripture or teſtimonie of auncient Father, I will alleadge no more abſurdities at this time till I be vrged.</p>

And yf, as you ſay, Abraham communicated; the ould teſtament alſo then wanted. So that ether your Scripture here mentioned, muſt not be any parte of the bible: or els you ouerthrow your ſaying in the 46. number, that Abraham (in whos tyme ther was no Scripture) communicated by fayth, as alſo all other faythfull: and that Chriſt, his Apoſtles, and primatiue Church were not of your perſuaſion, in whoſe tyme nothing of the new teſtament was vulgarly exſtant.</p>

                     <p>Out of which I obſerue, firſt, that <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> condemneth your carnall preſence and corporall eating, in telling you they muſt be eaten with the mind, not with the mouth: but of this we haue ſufficientlie ſpoken of before.</p>
                     <p>Secondlie, by comparriſon, he ſheweth you how you may bee guiltie of treaſon againſt the kings perſon (though he neither touch nor hurt his perſon) in offering diſgrace but to his garments, his perſon being abſent. And as he that contumeliouſly receiueth the princes ſeale (though of ware) is guiltie of the Maieſtie of the Prince, not which he receiueth, but which hee deſpiſeth: ſo he that eateth this bread, and drinketh this cup of the Lord without due preparation (as aforeſaid) conſidering they are ſeales of Chriſts promiſed benefits, purchaſed in his bitter and bleſſed paſſion, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth high treaſon againſt Chriſt: though in deed in ſubſtance they receiue but bred and wine. And as a man may be guiltie of treaſon in renting, defacing, or clipping the kings picture, ſeale, or coine, though the king be not locallie in place: ſo the wicked in the Sacraments which are Chriſt ſeales, which being abuſed by them, they are guiltie of Gods iudgements, though Chriſt be not incloſed locallie in the bread and wine.</p>
                     <p>And what <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſpeaketh here of the Lords Supper, the ſame hee doth of Baptiſme, and ſaith, a man may be as well guiltie of the Lords bodie and bloud in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temning Baptiſme, which is but a ſeale of his waſhing in the bloud of Chriſt, though hee neuer waſhed but in water, and alleadgeth <hi>Paul, Heb.</hi> 10 29, ſaing, Of how much ſorer puniſhment ſuppoſe yee ſhalbe be worthy which treadeth vnder foot the ſonne of God, &amp; counteth the bloud of the teſtament as an vnholie thing, &amp;c. Theſe Fathers haue aunſwered you, and I hope will ſatisfie fullie the indifferent Reader.</p>
                     <p>Now three ſorts of men are guilty of the body and bloud of the Lord. The firſt are plaine <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> that are without God or godlineſſe in this preſent world, and ſuch eate this bread vnworthelie, and therefore are guiltie of Chriſtes bodie and bloud.</p>

The neceſsitie of ſuch ſequel, or inference, is apparent, conſidering that any abuſe, or contempt in the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of a prince, is not more iniurious to a prince, then the lyke in a repreſentation of God, is to God.

I aunſwered, that I was vnworthely, both. Hee replyed: would you preferr your ſelfe befor a ſingle ſecular preeſt? I aunſwered, I neuer had yet controuerſie about preheminencie with any.

I replyed, then you are a Puritan, in as much as you refuſe the name of Deane: but as you hould the deanrie, you are a Proteſtant. At that tyme he hartely ſmyled at the conceit of that diſcourſe and ſo departed. Not long after his Maieſtie came to the crowne of England; and lyke a burnd child, fearing the feruent ambition of Puritans, obiected himſelfe againſt them. The name of puritans ſuddenly became odious therupon. Many well-benificed puritans, would at that tyme exclaime againſt their Conſorts, as ſeditious Schiſmaticks.

And what is better then the Body and Blood of Chriſt?</hi> By which ſweete, and ſownde teſtimonie, M. <hi>Rider</hi> as a conye is ferreted out of all his euaſions. For, the being Euchariſtial, and the being a Sacrament, and the names of bread, and wyne, are fownde to conſiſt with the body and blood of Chriſt, and rather to ateſtifie it, then to exclude it: becauſe Sacraments haue their names from ſacred and ſecret good, included vnder the couerture of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things. Which is verefyed in our Sacrament included vnder the forme, or couerture of bread and wyne. S. Chryſoſtom. 1. Cor. ho. 24. both elder then S. Gregorie, and alſo a naturall Grecian, ſignifyeth the ſence of Euchariſtical, to be all one and hallowed, or bleſſed, ſaying; <hi>Cum benedictionem dico, Euchariſtiam dico; VVhen I ſay bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, I ſay the Eucharist.</hi> Your Supper indureth no benediction: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for it can not be ſignifyed by the word Euchariſt, nor the word Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt belong therto; ſo that by degrees, all words belonging to this Sacrament, as Sacrament it ſelfe, ſigne, ſpiritual, Euchariſtical, my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical, are as erneſtly abandowing your profeſsion, as by it the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Sacraments is abandoned. In the meane tyme the forſayd teſtimonie confirmeth alſo, that thankſgiuing in this Sacrament, is rather to be taken for benediction, then benediction for thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing.</p>

body of Chriſt. As in Baptiſme the fleſh is waſhed by water (as that old father ſaith in that place) that the ſoule may be purged ſpirituallie: ſo our bodies eate the outward Sacrament, that the ſoule may be fed of God. Againe, it is not generallie true, that whatſoeuer the bodie eateth, the ſoule is fed by the ſame. And if you would propound but particularlie this, inſtance of eating onelie in the Sacrament, then the argument proueth nothing ſtanding vpon meere perticulers.</p>
                        <p>Moreouer, the bodie and ſoule are fed by the ſame meat in the ſacrament, but not after the ſame manner: For the bodie is nouriſhed by the naturall properties of the Elements which they haue to nouriſh: But the ſoule by the ſacramentall and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall power, as they are ſignes and feales of heauenlie graces. And we graunt that the ſoule is fed by the precious bodie &amp; bloud of Chriſt, but not after a carnall maner, as you ſay, but ſpirituallie by faith.</p>
                        <p>Againe, a mean Scholler in Gods booke, may ſee this phraſe is figuratiue, and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore the ſence ſpirituall.

The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior ſhalbe your owne woords. The faythe of the firſt fiue hondred yeares, is the ancient, true, and Catholick faythe: but that the fleaſhe and not only the ſoule, was fedd with the body and blood of Chriſt, was the fayth of the firſt fiue hondred (yea two hondred, within which Tertullian attayned the tyme of Chriſt) yeares: Ergo, that not only the ſowle, but the fleaſh was fedd with the body and blood of Chriſt, is the true and Catholick faythe. The minor are the woords of Tertullian which herein are ſo playne, that wofull and vayne is M. <hi>Riders</hi> witt and payne to ſtrugle againſt them. He telleth of an ould diſtinction, that the Sacrament is one thing, and the mater of the Sacrament is another. Be it true, or falſe; are
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:2419:140"/>
not the woords cleere that the very <hi>fleashe is fedd by the body of Chriſt,</hi> and ſuch diſtinction nothing pertinent, to affirme or denye them? Secondly, yf the body <hi>outwardly eate the Sacrament, and that</hi> (as after in him followeth) <hi>the body and ſoule are fedde by the ſame meat in the Sacrament and that he graunt the ſoule is fedd by the pretious body and blood of Chriſt:</hi> How can it poſsibly be denyed, but that the bodye alſo eateth the body and blood of Chriſt? To affirme that we hould, the ſoule to feede car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naly on Chriſt, is in maner declared to ryde; that is, to forge, and ſhamleſly to ſlaundre. For we only teach that the ſoule feedeth on Chriſts corporal body not carnaly, but realy, and truely, and yet ſpiritualy, but not only ſpiritualy. So that without any wrong, it is to be accompted the 105. vntruth, to ſay that we teach otherwyſe.<note place="margin">The 105. vntruth.</note> Should not ſuch an imputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue two or three, or at leaſt one quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, of ſome one, ould, or yong, noble, or obſcure, ſacred, or prophane, of our writers? it being ſo oft promiſed, ſo oft threatned? But M. <hi>Rider</hi> will performe theſe promiſes in his printed books, when he performeth other promiſes (the fruſtration wherof in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don was otherwyſe incountred, then in Dublin) in Merchands written books. When theſe be made Catholick, (that is not purita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicaly canceled, without a benediction; but Chriſtianly marked, with a fayre croſſe) then all other promiſes will alſo be more chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian lyke accompliſhed, and many a merchand reioyced, and many a long expectation ſatisfyed.</p>
                        <p>But (ſayth he) Chriſt recording to Tertullian is to be heard, to be meditated, remembred, and beleeued, and ſo Tertullian fayth he, hath aunſwered him ſelfe, and his former ſaying, that the fleaſh is fedde by the body of Chriſt. All this he quoteth: yet I doubt, not very faythfully. For I finde Tertullian printed at Paris, to haue the booke of reſurrection (out of which my teſtimonie is brought) ſo farr beyond the 47. yea and 407. page, euen in follio, that I can not make vnto my ſelfe any conceit, how theſe laſt woords are ſayd to be in the ſame booke following, and yet but in the 47. page. At this I ſtand not. Only I craue all curteous witts and wyſedoms, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue how and whether at all, Tertullian is made to aunſwer him ſelfe, and vs, by this late allegation, vnleſſe he would ſuppoſe that euery thing aunſwereth euery thing. For yf what may be heard, meditated, remembred, beleued, could not be receaued cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraly; then the Meſsias Chriſt our Saluiour, could neuer be recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the bleſſed virgins womb nor into the howſe or habitation of any other. Yet our beleefe aſſureth the contrary: and conſequently
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:2419:141"/>
the ſaying of Tertullian that our fleaſh is fedd by the body of Chriſt, remayneth in his full vigor, although thoſe other words be true. Nay rather they are more therby verifyed. For yf Chriſt be heard or beleued, his ſaying the bread to be his body ſhould not be diſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted. Could you be content to heare the former teſtimonyes auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, by euery by, and impertinent woord, that they were myſtical; Sacraments, Euchariſtical, and therefore not true: and can you not accept lyke maner of aunſwering in this place? I referre you to Luthers opinion of lyke their wonted anſwering mentioned in the 47. number. Although the former woords of Tertullian are inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable to M. <hi>Riders</hi> clayme, and that he ſtrugleth in vayne againſt them, yet I will ſecond them, with this concluſion out of the ſayd <hi>Tertullian.

For it was hee that died for his enemies, that left vs his fleſh, &amp;c. And that was Chriſt, not God the father. But you begunne (after your accuſtomed manner) in the middeſt of a ſentence, miſtaking the nominatiue caſe to the verbe; and ſo lay downe hereſie for diuinitie: for God the Father hath neither fleſh nor blould.

                        <p>But thus <hi>Cyprian</hi> is to be read: Chriſt hath left vs his fleſh to eate and his bloud to drinke: ſo we confeſſe it, we beleeue it, and we teach it: but to be eaten and drunke ſpirituallie by faith, not corporallie, not gutturallie, as you imagine.

                        <p>You leaue out in two lines theſe foure words, <hi>Quaſi per manus,</hi> and <hi>ſpiritualiter:</hi> you left out <hi>quaſi</hi> becauſe belike it was but an Aduerb of likeneſſe, and ſo becauſe <hi>omne ſimile</hi> is not <hi>idem.</hi> you thought it were better to leaue it behinde, then to bring it to your hurt. Secondlie, you leaue out <hi>per manus,</hi> for your Authour ſaith, <hi>per ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus ſacerdotum,</hi> by the handes of the Prieſtes, and you leaue them both out, and ſay, <hi>per ſacerdotem,</hi> leaſt the people ſhould thinke and ſay, if onelie the Prieſt made it, then it, can neither haue fleſh nor bloud, and ſo the miracle were marred.</p>
                        <p>And therfore it were better to leaue out <hi>per manus,</hi> and to ſay <hi>per ſacerdotem,</hi> by the Prieſt, for then might be vnderſtood not onelie all the members of his bodie, and intentions of his minde, but alſo the geſtures and motions of both, required to the conception of ſuch a wodden Sauiour.</p>
                        <p>And laſtlie, you leaue out <hi>ſpiritualiter,</hi> ſpirituallie, hee ſaith not carnallie, and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:2419:144"/>
therefore this proofe is verie vnſchollerlike alleadged: when our queſtion is of a preſence carnall, you produce a preſence ſpirituall: this word makes for vs, but that wee ſcorne (and knowe it ſinfull) to bring in ſuch forgerie (for proofe) in a queſtion of diuinitie.

And why ſhould concils be collected, but to reforme errours? How wyſe the firſt exception is, let God and Man iudge.

The third reaſon: Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius wrote againſt idolatrie, therfor he wrote not this idolatrous hiſtorie.

He that receaueth Chriſts ſeales vnworthily (ſayth M. <hi>Rider</hi> n. 96.) committeth high treaſon againſt Chriſt: therfore it is as greuous an offenſe to deuoure his ſeales vnworthilie as to deuoure his bodye.

he telleth you not how: but, becauſe thoſe two woords, had ſome conſonance in ſound; hauing only cuppled them together, as hunters do hounds of lyke coloure and proportion, he taketh his leaue, and is galloped away. I haue ſome tyme noted the ſame refuge, &amp; euaſion to the ſame woords, in Latimere, of whom Fox pag. 1325. col. 1. num. 27. deliuereth his aunſwer, ſaying; <hi>It is true as touching the mater; but not as tuching the maner of the thing.</hi> The ſame is repeated in the 70. number following, in a playne contradiction of it ſelfe in this former place.

For be it to the purpoſe, or againſt it, yet they that know not what mater, and what maner is, may ſurmiſe ſome anſwer giuen. But I pray you (gentle Readers) to conceaue (the matter of the B.

For what ſoeuer it vnderstandeth not, streight throwgh arrogance it reiecteth as friuolous and falſe, yealding to nothing, nor thinking any thing aboue it ſelfe: ſuche as we shall fynde the Iewes to haue bene. For it behoued them who had perceaued the diuine vertue and power of our ſaluiour, by miraculous ſignes, willingly to imbrace his ſpeeche, and yf in any thing there ſeemed difficulties, to ſeeke their ſolution. They did alltogether the contrarie. And how can this man giue vs his fleashe? Of God not withowt great impietie they crye together, and it came not into their mynds that there was nothing impoſible to God.</hi>

Therfor Nicodemus alſo when he ſayd, How can theſe things be? he heard worthely: art thow a master in Iſrael, and art ignorant of theſe? Therfor by other mens offenſe we being instructed, when God woorketh, let vs not demand, How! but leaue the knowledge, and waye of his woorke, to him alone. For as no man knoweth what God is according to nature, yet is iuſtifyed by fayth by beleeuing that he will reward him that ſeeketh him: ſo being ignorant of the reaſon of his woorks wheras by fayth he doubteth not that he can do all things, he shall obtayne no diſpiſeable rewards for this good diſpoſition.

For this word <hi>(Sicut)</hi> which you leaue out, ſheweth plainlie that it is a ſimilitude, and I hope you knowe that ſimilitudes be no <hi>Sillogiſmes.</hi> And as there was no obſcenitie or abſurditie in the ſimilitude of marriage (they trulie ſhall be one fleſh): ſo in like caſe, here is no abſurditie or inhumaine Caniballiſme, in this ſimilitude of the Sacrament, vſed to expreſſe our vnion with Chriſt: for though it ſeem more horrible to eate rhe fleſh of man, then to kill man, and to drinke his bloud then to ſhed it: yet we without horror or abſurditie, eat the fleſh and drinke the bloud of the Mediator betwixt God &amp; man Ieſus Chriſt. And if the aduerſarie in <hi>Augustines</hi> time, or you Romaniſts now, would know how this may bee ſo done without ſlaughter of Chriſt, ſinne to our ſoules, or offence to the world, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> tells you in that place, <hi>fideli corde &amp; ore,</hi> with a faithfull heart and mouth.</p>
                        <p>So that now you ſee <hi>Auguſtines</hi> ſcope, and your drift, cleane contrarie the one to
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:2419:156"/>
the other: for <hi>Augustine</hi> brings it as a ſimilitude to expreſſe our ſpirituall vnion with Chriſt by faith: you wreſt it as ſpoken of the corporall and gutturall eating and drinking of Chriſts bodie and bloud in the Sacrament, vnder the formes of bread and wine with our mouths and ſtomackes. Manie places you haue vnfitlie, &amp; in deed vntrulie alleadged: yet ſhewed in none of them leſſe learning and true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, then in this. For this is your great fault, that whereſoeuer you ſee or heare in Scripture, Father, Councell, or hiſtorie: <hi>Corpus &amp; ſanguinem Domini,</hi> or ſuch like words or phraſes, preſentlie you inferre (and ſo perſuade the Catholicks) that there is Chriſts carnal preſence in the Sacrament, neuer examining the circumſtance of the place, or the end wherefore they be alleadged.</p>
                        <p>And thus you erre not knowing (or wilfullie contemning) the ſtate of the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the ſence of the holie writ, and iudgement of the auncient Fathers.</p>
                        <p>I am ſure you neuer read this place of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> your ſelfe, but ſnatcht it out of ſome late ignorant and fooliſh ydle Munkiſh or Franciſcan <hi>Enchiridion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And my reaſon why I thinke ſo of you, is drawen out of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> himſelfe. For a few lines before this your proofe, he calleth the Sacraments <hi>Sacra ſigna,</hi> holie ſignes (not the things themſelues as you doe) and ſo diſtinguiſheth that which you confounde. And within three lines after your proofe, if you would haue read him, you ſhould haue heard him record to your great diſcredit in this caſe, that this your proofe is (as other former examples are) <hi>figurate dictum ſecundum ſacra fidei regulam:</hi> that it is ſpoken figuratiuelie, according to the rule of ſound faith and religion.</p>
                        <p>Now let the Reader iudge betwixt you and mee, whether of vs is in the right.<note place="margin">Auguſt. in this place as in the places for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly alledged, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you ſtill.</note> 
                           <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith, the Sacraments be <hi>ſacra ſigna,</hi> holie ſignes, and ſo ſay wee: But you Ieſuiets and Prieſts ſay no, they be the things themſelues. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith it is ſpoken figuratiuelie, and ſo ſay we: you ſay no, but properlie. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, that this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is ſquared out for patterne to Chriſts Church, by the ſtraight rule of ſound faith, and ſo ſay we: and as you alleadge your proofe, you ſay no: &amp; make a flat oppoſition betwixt <hi>Auguſtines</hi> faith and your faith. And yet you will brag of Fathers, and that they all ſpeake on your ſide, and you all follow their ſayings: when they neither ſpeake, for you, nor you imitate them. And ſo though we follow ſcripture, fathers, &amp; primitiue Church, yet you cal vs heretiks. And you that wreſt ſcriptures, falſifie fathers, that haue neither with you, conſent, antiquitie, nor veritie, yet will be Catholickes.</p>
                        <p>And thus if a man ſhould haue hired you to haue brought a place out of <hi>Augustine</hi> againſt your ſelues, you could no better haue fitted your ſelfe, or your ſetter on, then in this: who verie plainlie deliuereth the manner how Chriſts bodie and bloud is to bee eaten and drunke: that is, with a faithfull heart and mouth, not with our materiall mouth, teeth, and ſtomacke, as you vntrulie teach. And thus hoping the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks will leſſe truſt you in the reſt, that haue ſo groſlie deceiued them in this, I will proceed by Chriſtes aſiſtance to the examination of your next proofe.</p>

It is often, and at euery ſuch reprehenſion, before declared: here alſo it is conſpicious. For out of the Latin, he omitteth this whole lyne [which in the Church of God is ſo conſonant, in the mouthes of all] when that he tooke vpon him to tranſlate the ſentence moſt exactly according as S.

Their hatred againſt the name of Church (wherby in the Bible of the yeare 1562. it was intierly excluded) and their want of vniuerſal conſent, blinded him not to behould this lyne; or inforced him, to diſſemble it.

                     <p>In your third queſtion, and third aunſwer, is contayned, firſt, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 154. vntrueth,<note place="margin">The 154. 155. &amp; 156. vntruth.</note> that Scripturs and Fathers, ſay with you.

In the 4. aunſwer, is the 158. vntrueth: that whatſoeuer <hi>Christ</hi> giueth by promiſe, muſt be receaued by faythe. For he giueth damnation to the wicked infidels, which he had often promiſed: yet they haue no faythe. He giueth reſurrection to our bodyes, in his
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:2419:168"/>
promiſes: yet bodyes haue no faythe. He giueth health, foode, attyre, by many promiſes to his ſeruants: which can not be receaued, or vſed, but only by their bodyes. He giueth baptiſme and grace to children: yet they haue no actual fayth: he giueth by promiſe foode to the fowles of the ayre, to the fiſh of the ſea, and to the beaſts of the earth: can theſe be ſayd to haue fayth? yet, I confeſſe, they may haue as much as puritans, &amp; haue none at all. O rich Deanry of <hi>S.

                     <p>In the fift queſtion and firſt aunſwer, is the 159. vntrueth:<note place="margin">The 159. vntruth.</note> that it is abſurd, by our bodyes to receaue Chriſt: as alſo, that we exclude the receauing by our ſowles. In the third aunſwer to the 5. queſtion, is the 160. vntrueth,<note place="margin">The 160. vntruth.</note> that ether ſuch inſtitution as I ſayd was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, or a thing ſpiritual alone, and not alſo corporal.

Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he is, and well may be called, the giuer of grace. And fayne would I know, two things, mentioned in this aunſwer of yours to the 7. queſtion; Firſt, why you ſay Chriſt crucifyed, with all his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, to be the mater, or inward grace of the Sacrament; conſidering Chriſt ordained it befor his being crucifyed. Secondly, why you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe any other his merits beſyd his paſsion, conſidering, that in the 83. number &amp; 14. examen, you affirme only his paſsion, or rather the wownd of his ſyde, to haue bene fruictfull for your redemption?</p>
                     <p>To the 8. queſtion, and firſt aunſwer: it is the 164. vntrueth.<note place="margin">The 164. vntruth.</note> For we ſay no ſuch mater of carnal eating, but of corporal, true, real, and ſubſtantial eating: and that, not only by mowth, but alſo by charitie, and faythe.

The ſumme of this aunſwer to Luthers authoritie is, that Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath fayled lyke a monck, &amp; that the Father of proteſtant trueth, as them ſelues tearme him, is but a Father of error. A good verdict. For the name of Proteſtants here taken from the Lutherans, we will examine how rightly it is done.</p>

I muſt therfor diſmount you, into your rancke. Firſt, the name of Proteſtant, ſprong vpon this following occaſion. When the Reforming profeſsion had purchaſed many followers, (as it is no more meruaile to behould numbers to follow a doctrin of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, then waters to fall from a height, when a gappe is opened) and the Emperoure Charles the fift would fayne vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the grownds of their perſwaſions:<note place="margin">Sleidan. lib. <hi>6.</hi> fol. <hi>101. 102. 109.</hi> Lauather. in ſua hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoria pag. <hi>19.</hi>
                        </note> they ioyned their heads together, and made a collection of opinions, to which they proteſted to ſtand to. Which booke being deliuered to the Emperoure at Auguſta, otherwyſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Auſpurg, anno 1530. ſome thirteene yeeres after Luther had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtated; and the greater parte by manifowld proteſtants (wherby the name begon) promiſing to auow the ſaid booke: the booke to this day, is called the Confeſsion of Auguſta; and the only defenders therof, are called proteſtants. Nether do the Zuinglians in Heluetia, clayme this name, but are knowen by the title of Sacramentarians; nether the Geneuians, or French reformers, but are knowen by the title of Hugenots; nor the Flemiſh rebells, but are knowen by the title of Ghewes. Secondly, concerning this name of proteſtants, they to whom it doth belong, haue duble cauſe to applawd greatly to them ſelues: Such only, (as I forſhewed) are the Lutherans, and they only that are conſenting to the forſayd confeſsion of Auguſta.
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:2419:169"/>
The firſt cauſe is, that the Zuinglians, the Engliſhe, the Frenche, &amp;c. <hi>haue ſought,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Brentius in appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.</note>

And when, they blazed abroad, that they had the good lyking of them; the proteſtants tooke it moſt iniuriouſly, and (as a great ſlaundre) ſharply refuted it. Exam. nu. 19.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond cauſe is, that their very name of Proteſtants, is ſo much affected, euen by them, who are oppoſit vnto their profeſsion (as appeareth in England) as that they couet it, and ſtriue for it In deed the cauſe why that name had firſt acceſſe into England, was, becauſe the firſt reformers who reſorted therto, Tindal, Frith, Barns, Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, &amp;c. were of the Lutheran ſtampe, with a peculiar ſmall diuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Now, <hi>M. Rider</hi> are you a Proteſtant? Yf you conſent with the Auguſtan confeſsion, and ſo be a proteſtant (for otherwyſe you can not) then you muſt recant all your opinion againſt the real preſence, and conſent with Luther. But you perhapps will diſtinguiſh Engliſh Proteſtants, with Thomas Digges your brother Puritan,<note place="margin">Thomas Digges in his humble motiues anno 1601.</note> from all others, by calling them ſtate Proteſtants: and ſo intrude, &amp; incroache, among them.

But that the good man miſtaketh the occaſion, and altogether miſ-informeth his reader in this mater; may be gathered by theſe ſhort demonſtrations follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing. The firſt is: that yf as he ſayth, they had intended not to medle with the mater of the preſence, why would they condemne the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of them, who did not beleeue ſuch real preſence? <hi>An ſint facienda mala vt inde eueniant bona?</hi> could ill be done, that good (as that lyfe, or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings might be preſerued therby) might come therof? The Apoſtle flatly teacheth the contrary: Nether is the authoritie of Beza, or Cartwright, who granted (as is declared) ſuch allowance, (to cown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfet for helping the woord) Chriſtian or religious. Now the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Proteſtants renounced the figuratiue imaginarie preſence, as he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical, and profeſſed to beleeue the real and ſubſtantial preſence. <hi>For as much</hi> (ſayd S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

I beleeue in that Sacrament, to be contayned very Chriſts body and blood, vnder the ſimilituds of wyne and bread; yea the ſame body that was concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the holy Ghost, borne of the Virgin Marie.</hi> Ouer this confeſsion, is by Fox written: <hi>the Chriſtian beleefe of the Lord Cobham.</hi> If it was Chriſtian:<note place="margin">Fox Acts and Mon. pag. 512.</note> how is not the contrary therto, vnchriſtian?

                     <p>Such, and in lyke tearmes, euen by Foxes owne relation, was the Proteſtation of the L.

Yet I come neerer, and omitting Ridley, Hooper, Rogers, Latimer, the Duke of Northumberland, and others, great Saincts, with Fox: I craue in curteſie of <hi>M.

They in a Chriſtian &amp; brotherlie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:2419:172"/>
exhorted the learned bretheren, onelie to preach that neceſſarie Article of our free iuſtification by faith in the perſonall merits of Chriſt. And touching the Lords Supper, to teach to the people the right vſe of the ſame; yet not to meddle with the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the preſence, for feare of daunger, if not death: but leaue it as a thing indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, till the matter in a time of peace might be reaſoned at large on both parties by the learned.

                     <p n="2">2 Secondlie, they wiſhed the bretheren (conſidering it was but mans inuention, and neuer recorded in gods booke) that therefore they ſhould not hazard the loſſe of their liues, which would tend ſo much to the preiudice of Chriſts Church.</p>

Of his ignorance in Scripture, in Fathers, in Hiſtories, in Orthographie, in Greeke, in Frenche, in Latin, in English, &amp; now in Spelling, againſt my will, he would needs conuict him ſelfe ignorant. Firſt then I anſwer, that K. in greeke, is all one and C. in Latin: and therfor might indifferently be taken. Secondly, that German names, ſuch as are Kemnitius, and Crantzius, are written indifferently by ether C. or K. &amp; that theſe two forſayd names, euen by the authours them ſelues, are more written in our maner, then according to <hi>M.

                           <hi>Act.</hi> 2.</note> in communicating the B. Sacrament: yet without any mention of the vſe of wyne. The ſame appeareth to haue bene the general practiſe of all Chriſtians; ſo to be contented with the B.

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Secondly by the vſe of Chriſtians in firſt tymes, when they had litle commoditie of Prieſts or Churches, they tooke home to their houſes, the B.

                        </note> ther being no ſuch for the forme of wyne. Yet, (as I forwarned) the vſe of the chalice was indifferently

allowed to lay people (as partly appeareth by the requeſt of Maria Aegiptiaca, numb. 115.) according to the ſeueral commodities of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; vntil by reaſon of danger, as I fortould, of ſowring, and ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and of errours increaſing, the Church reſtrayned it from the lay people.

I grant, that a Preeſt ſhould not contemne his wyfe, but according his obligation expreſſed in ſeueral Concils, be carefull of hir, prouid for hir, and content hir; but as is there ſignifyed; <hi>abſque vlla ſuſpicione carnalis commercij: without any ſuſpition of carnal compagnie.</hi> Now marke this Riderian ſequel: a preeſt may not, by pretext of religion wherby he is bound to be continent, diſpiſe his wyfe, from whom he is departed (for ſo, by teſtimonies of the forſayd Concils, it is to be vnderſtood) therfor a Preeſt may marry; or hauing bene marryed may carnaly conuerſe with his wyfe. Who would not pittie his fathers loſſe, yf he had bene at any charges (as he was not able) for his ſonns bringing vpp? For although a ſonne can not deſpiſe his mother, yet followeth it not, that he may marry hir. Thirdly, the

Now, to anſwer the circumſtances tendred by you, and to the formeſt, whether the forſayd eight learned men were not all ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiuely Archbiſhops. I ſay firſt, chat the hiſtorie doth not contayne they had bene any ſuch ſucceſsiuely: vnles you would haue them Puritanical Biſhops. For in the text of S. Bernard they are ſayd to haue bene; <hi>abſ<expan>
                              <am>

I could the ſooner thynke them to haue bene Puritan Biſhops, the rather for being without ordres; as well becauſe they do not allow any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct ordre of cleargie, as alſo becauſe they are enemyes, to all ordres, and the diſordred diſturbers of all well ordered common wealthes, and breaders of confuſion. <hi>Qua non immanior vlla peſtis, &amp; ira Deum ſtygio ſeſe extulit Orco.</hi> Secondly, that they were (named by S. Bernard) no Biſhops, but in figure, repreſentation, and appellation, as you ſay Chriſt to be in the B. Sacrament. For yf you may ſay Chriſt not to be otherwyſe in the B. Sacrament,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> notwithſtanding his woords of being truely preſent, the ſame who was deliuered in his paſsion: I may ſay, being bowlſtered by the lawes of Gods Church, and ſuch proofs as I haue produced n. 99. of impoſition of hands, that they could not otherwyſe, then as aforſayd, be Archbiſhops. Next I let paſſe your ſweet reuyling, of the tyrannical, and diabolical Romain yoake. Thirdly the nobilities repugning againſt the Pope is added to the text, by a 186. vntrueth. For nether Pope,<note place="margin">The 186. vntruth.</note> nor Papiſt aſſaulted them: how could they then defend them ſelues with their ſwoords againſt the Pope; eſpecialy not hate of papiſtrie, but loue of ſacrilege, being their impulſion to ſuche vprore? The 187. vntrueth is,<note place="margin">The 187. vntruth.</note> that
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:2419:187"/>
they refuſed to receaue Orders, Biſhopricks, or decrees from Rome. For nether is any profre, nor any ſuch refuſe, recorded. Yf Bernard ſo ſharply reprehended them in the Popes quarell, for not being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the Popes orders, or decrees: in the name of Ieſus, why did you in your Preface informe your readers, that S. Bernard tould the Pope to his face, that his ſupremacie was vnlawfull? <hi>O quantum mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantur ab illis?</hi> O how farr are theſe woords repugnant to thoſe? That thoſe eight preached the goſpell, and miniſtred the Sacraments; is an addition of your making: As alſo, that the nobilitie, and gentilitie, cared not two pence for Papal bleſsings, or curſsings. Whether they came to ſuch infidelitie, or noe, there is great want of fidelitie in your deprauation of the hiſtorie as S. Bernard affoordeth it. That they changed their ould Apoſtolical religion; yf you meane according as your authour informeth them to haue changed (as you ſhould be tyed to your autheurs relation, and the ſenſe therof, vnleſſe you would be accompted a falſifier, rather then interpreter) what you call owld Apoſtolical religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, according to your conceit, is according to trueth, and your authour S. Bernard, <hi>deuilish ambition, diſſolution of eccleſiastical diſciplin, ouerthrow of religion, and Chriſtianitie, &amp;c. O quantum mutantur ab illis? O how farr are theſe woords of the authour, diſſenting from theſe woords of the interpreter?</hi> That they are become ſlaues to the late Italian Preiſt the Pope, Gods enemye, and the Queens butcher; I know not how wyſe a ſpeeche it may ſeeme to any: this I am ſuer, yf they be ſlaues by being only Catholicks (for other ſlauerie I thinke the Pope expecteth not at their hands) it ſhould not repent them: for, <hi>ſeruire Deo regnare eſt; to ſerue God is to raigne.</hi> And I could wiſhe, that as they affect to be accompted ſuch; ſo they would better effect the dutie belonging to ſuch. Yf the Pope be no truer Gods enemie, then he is late,<note place="margin">The 188. vntruth.</note> or the Queens, butcher, the 188. vntrueth may to all mens ſeeming, be calculated. That then they drew then ſwoords againſt the Pope to defend trueth; the informer of the mater, the puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſent from heauen, the former Proteſtant reſolutions related in our anſwer to your Preface, that trueth was vnbegotten, till Luthers tyme,<note place="margin">The 189. vntruth.</note> do conioyntly regiſter for the 189. vntrueth Wheras you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke the Noble men and Gentlemen of Irland, to imitat ſuch ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours in their true honor; you flatly perſwad them to inſurrection, and rebellion. For yf they imitat them, they will indeuour to kill their King, and ſuch Biſhop as he would eſtabliſh: they will enter into diueliſh ambition, &amp;c. For ſo did they (by information of S.

For yf one of ours mantayne this point of controuerſie, how is euery one of vs, ſayd to be againſt it? For the honor of God, <hi>M. Rider,</hi> leaue colluſions, and impoſturs, in abuſing your fraternitie with ſuch iuggling doctrin, being faſt and looſe, off and on, vp and downe, without ryme, or reaſon. Thirdly, S.

Yf any ſay that marriage for religions ſake may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued, although lawe of men accord therto, yet the lawe of God doth forbidd it:</hi> to witt (as he there expoundeth) that without mutual conſent they ſhould diuorce them ſelues, for any pretext to enter into religion. And nether is this againſt vs, not allowing the contrary; nor for him,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to approue marriage of Preiſts: becauſe it ſpeaketh only of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of marriage inuiolably, (vnleſſe mutual conſent be graunted) befor any man attayne to preeſthod, or religion. So that it is farr more for our purpoſe, that he that can not gett his wyfs conſent to be deuorced can not be Preeſt; and none Preeſt, but (yf he were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed) which hath ſuch conſent to remayne diuorced.

Rider</hi> conſiſteth in two impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant accuſations; The one, that the denyers of the real preſence, as ſoone as they tooke vp ſuch opinion, were condemned as hereticks. Th'other, that when they tooke it vp, they had none to accord vnto them. So that only Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius and Theodoret could fynde but a glawnce of ſuch opinion: which vaniſhed for want of followers in ſuch maner, as Ireneus, Tertullian, Philaſter, Epiphan, Auguſtin, Damaſcen, &amp;c. in their calculation of hereſies, could fynde none ſo vnfaythfull as to diſtruſt the trueth of Chriſts real preſence. To this vrgent accuſation, <hi>M. Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> only anſwereth, firſt that we ſhould haue brought Theodoret be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Ignatius. In deed, as I haue ſayd befor, when I am a Puritan wryter, I will follow their prepoſterous proceeding, and place Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius that was three hondred yeeres befor Theodoret, (yet both were within the firſt fiue hundred yeares) behinde him; &amp; Theodoret that
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:2419:194"/>
alleageth anothers monuments, I will place before the monument wryter, as yf he were a prophet to fortell what ſhould be written. Secondly he anſwereth, that Ignatius him ſelfe hath not one woord therof. Wherunto I reply, that the greater our loſſe, by not hauing ſo much of his wrytings as were found by Theodoret. Thirdly he anſwereth, that it ſeemeth we neuer read Theodoret, becauſe we ſay about the middeſt of his third dialogue; not knowing in which of the 33. chapters it was. I replye: that the later chapters being more long then the former, I had not ſtrayed, in ſpecifying the middeſt in the 19. chapter. Alſo it is but a Riderian ſequel, you know not the chapter: therfor you neuer read the mater. In our 135. number, I demonſtrat, that you miſtake the number of S. Ignatius epiſtle: will you therfor be confounded by your owne ſequel, that you neuer read the woords? Thirdly he anſwereth, that the point of the obiection, is but a Sacramental Metonimie. To which I reply, that this anſwer is <hi>M. Riders</hi> ignominie; to vſe obſcure woords vnexpownded, &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the mater. What Sacramental is, I haue often befor decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. For Metonymie, it is thus defyned by Feſtus: <hi>Metonymia est tropus, quum quod continet ſignificatur per id quod continetur. &amp;c. Metonymie is a figure, when it that contayneth is ſignifyed, for it that is contayned, </hi> as yf you would ſay, drinke of this cuppe, meaning the liquoure in the cupp. This denomination of the cupp for the liquoure, is a Meto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymie.</p>
                     <p>Now hauing vnmasked <hi>M. Riders</hi> woords, I may be licenſed to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min how they ſerue his defenſe againſt the accuſation out of S. Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius. For he thought as Agar abandoned hir child vnder a buſhe,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.</note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning remot till it had dyed, to leaue the obiection without any other conſolation then that in placing it in an obſcure ſhaddow; and retyred farr from it, lamenting his owne extremitie. But I will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plye to him the office performed by the Angel to <hi>Agar,</hi> and ſay:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.</note> 
                        <hi>take vp the Child:</hi> meaning the forſayd obiection by him forlorned, contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in theſe woords, of <hi>Ignatius. Eucharistias &amp; oblationes non admittunt, quod non confiteantur Euchariſtiam eſſe carnem ſeruatoris noſtri Ieſu Chriſti; They allow not Euchariſts, and oblations, becauſe they do not confeſſe the eucharist to be the fleash of our Keeper Ieſus Christ.</hi> Compare <hi>M. Riders</hi> tropical anſwer to this accuſation; and tell after, that it is out of the compaſſe of both the tropicks limiting the Zodiac; So that the ſonn of playne dealing can not reach to be directly ouer it. Here is then <hi>Agars</hi> child Iſmael re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyued to the Puritan opinion againſt the real preſence; <hi>Ferus homo, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus eius contra omnes; a fierce fellow, his hands impugning them all:</hi>

<pb n="352" facs="tcp:2419:195"/>
Scripture telleth Iſmael to haue bene. So that <hi>M. Riders</hi> expectation, that it ſhould haue dyed by being placed in a darke thicket of remote words is fruſtrated, and it now a fierce and cruel aduerſarie to them that denye the Euchariſt, and Sacrifices; as prouing them in their firſt originals to haue bene apparent hereticks. The forſayd denyers of the Euchariſt to be the fleſhe of Chriſt, being the firſt of that opinion (yet in deed, they were perſwaded rather that the Euchariſt was not Chriſts fleaſh, becauſe they thought he had not fleaſh, then yf he had any, that his woords ſo pregnant to teſtifie ſuche trueth, had not made the Euchariſt to be his fleaſh: and by conſequent, the hereſies of theſe tymes were condemned in them, not otherwyſe but by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation; to witt, for denying the Euchariſt to be Chriſts fleaſh, and yet confeſsing that Chriſt had fleaſhe) and for it diſproued as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. To come agayne to his affected obſcuritie; what vſe, or effect, do the woords of <hi>M. Rider</hi> importe, <hi>[that the ſpeeche was but a Srcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Metonomye]</hi> to defend them, &amp; their imaginations therby? Ether the Metonomie is to be referred to the perſons, or to the perſwaſion, or to the condemnation of the perſons, and perſwaſion, or to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demners, of their condemnation. In any way in the world that it can <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> be imagined, it is no more to any purpoſe proffit, or defenſe, then a ſingle netwoorke or loome apron, to couer a naked frozen bodye. But why ſhould the dealing be defenſiue or playne, in ſuch a meaning? why ſhould he diſcouer intelligibly, that which diſcouereth his cauſe moſt pertinently, and infallibly; and not rather, as he did, fall to a puritanical euaſion in pretending to ſay much, when he had ſayd nothing at all but a Metonomie; that is, a naked figure without all ſubſtantial contents? Fowerthly he anſwereth, that elswher Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret will expownd him ſelfe, and confute vs. To whiche, I replye; that this is at leaſt the 191. vntrueth: for nether th'one, nor th'other, is in all Theodoret.<note place="margin">The 191. vntruth.</note> Nether could he confute vs, but by firſt confuting him ſelfe. Alſo yf he did ſo expownd him ſelfe, and confute vs; <hi>M. Rider</hi> hauing any regard of his credit, ſhould haue brought ſuche confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and omitted his voyde, and blynd miſt of a Sacramental Meto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomie in place therof. Fiftly he anſwereth, that we belye Ignatius. To which I reply, that I attended (according my experience of many greater diſcurteſies indured at his hands,<note place="margin">Calu. de vera parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cip. Corporis Chriſti in coena pag. <hi>1171.</hi>
                        </note> as befor is ſhewed) this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe; conſidering in the ſame caſe I found it vſed by Caluin, againſt Heſhuſius. But <hi>M. Rider</hi> for recompenſe and ſatisfaction, will take this 192. vntrueth,<note place="margin">The 192. vntruth.</note> in his owne mouth, confeſsing Theodoret to haue in his 19. chapter, what we had alleaged. In whom then, is the lye?
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:2419:195"/>
He dareth not to ſay that it is in Theodoret, being a moſt venerable Father within the firſt fiue hondred yeares. And he can not ſay, it is in me, who haue only certifyed (and that truely, as he confeſſeth) what Theodoret alleaged out of S. Ignatius. There remayneth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for, that he can beſtow it no where ſo well as in his owne lipps: wher, it is, <hi>rex in regno, res in fine, loco<expan>

To which I reply, that the proofe bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring title, whether ancient denyers of the real preſence were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for hereticks, and it being ſhewed that Ichonomachi were ſuch denyers, and ſo condemned; it can not poſsibly be auoyded; But <hi>M.

<pb n="354" facs="tcp:2419:196"/>
ſayd that Chriſtians do worſhipp images as Gods, and that images and idols are all one. Do not theſe canons and condemnations rather battre late reforming hereſies, then any way in the world, directly, or indirectly, concerne any anſwer to my euidences? What! are all impertinent awnſwers, (although new condemnations of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers) due ſatisfaction to all obiections againſt Reformers?

FOr his firſt anſwer,<note place="margin">Fitzſimon.</note> to this recantation of the firſt late head of his opinion (who could neuer faſhion any mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous body therto of adherents) he ſayth; a particular doth not conclud a general. Which being true, what mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable concluſions hath he made in his whole booke? When yf a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure was to be graunted in one woord, therby was concluded that all the ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tence was but figuratiue. Yf there were lyke forme of ſpeech and ſownd of leters in the ould and new teſtament; therby was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, there was noe more liberalitie, or ſubſtance, in the new, then in the ould; yf ſpiritual ſenſe was affirmed, in any one ſentence, of Scriptures, or Fathers; therby was concluded nothing was literal. Yf any one Prelat, and any one booke, yea the very Antiphonarie, was worthy to be reformed; the liues of all Catholicks, was therby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to be lewed, and all their doctrin deuiliſhe. Yf any ſentence, yea impertinently, were alleaged out of any Father; the towne, the prouince, the Kingdome, that region of the world, Europe, Africk, Aſia, were inferred to hould the ſame; although, nether perſon, nor place, nor prouince, of ſuch Region, (as appeareth in our 60. num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, when Aſie is made to hould an opinion, without any of all Aſie ſpecifyed for being author therof) is numbred. What ſay you <hi>M. Rider?</hi> can reaſons drawen from a particular, conclud generaly? you inſinuating that according to learning they can not. Spitt out man, &amp; let trueth haue once a cleane ſeat in your mouth, &amp; confeſſe in plaine deed that they can not: and conſequently confeſſe, that your infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences hitherto haue bene at leaſt friuolous, and vnlearned. Secondly
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:2419:197"/>
I reply, that this recantation, and condemnation of Berengarius was not particular: the condemnation being by three whole Concils; and the recantation being,<note place="margin">Calu. in vltima. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monit. ad Ioachim. VVeſtphalum.</note> as Caluin confeſſeth, by the parent of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentarian opinion, in his owne behalfe, and of his children: in ſo much, as thervpon, to the tymes of the Albigenſes, and Ihon Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff, few or none could be found taynted with that errour. Secondly, he accuſeth Bonner, and Standiſh, to haue diſſembled in their beleefe. I thinke in my conſcience the accuſation is vntrue; and the rather, becauſe ther is nether witnes, nor authour, beſyd his owne crackt credit to auerr it. But let vs ſuppoſe it to be true: all that followeth therby is, that they borrowed Puritanical diſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſations to them ſelues mentioned in the 99. number, to do contrary to their conſciences. Deale playnly in Gods cauſe, &amp; tell the world whether the late thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſubſcribing Puritans, haue not all of them drawen in their horns, and ſwayed with the tyme. How many tymes did Latymer and Crammer, recant, vp, and downe? So then, ſuch did Puritanize. Thirdly he anſwereth, that ſubornation of witneſes, and packing of Iuries done in Weſtminiſter Hall, is puniſhed in the ſtarr chamber: therby implying that the Pops ſubornation of his ſtipendarie (this is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> conceaued a good woord, that it is ſo often repeated) Chaplins, ſhalbe puniſhed for condemnation of Berengarius. To which I reply, firſt out of S. Auguſtin, to be an ould wont of Sectariſts; <hi>Quicquid ex eorum codicibus aduerſus eos ſonuerit,</hi>

Secondly I would be inſtructed willingly in the cauſe of his knowledge, how all the Biſhops of the three concils wherby Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rengarius was condemned, are found to haue bene the Popes ſtipen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darie chaplins. Peter of Nicomedie is made the Popes penſioner, as alſo S. Bernard, and all that can be alleaged againſt Proteſtants. But why? <gap reason="foreign">

Yf you diſtruſt him, or his ſayings, you are inferred to be trayterous, ſuperſtitious, &amp;c. Thirdly, how fyndeth he among his Spiritual reuelations, that the Popes rotten kingdome declineth? For as I ſhewed not long befor, it hath to our ſeeming neuer in three ages formerly, bene ſo farr extended, as in this laſt, and more, and more foloweth on the ſame tenor. Fourthly, in what Chronologie findeth he, that euery one of the ſayd ſtipendarie chaplins, liued at leaſt 1100.
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:2419:197"/>
yeares after Chriſts aſcenſion? The concil <hi>ſub Victore</hi> 2. was in the yeare 1055. The Concil <hi>ſub Nicolao</hi> 2. was anno 1059. and the Concil vnder Gregorie the 7. was anno 1073. not after Chriſts aſcenſion, but after his birthe. If therfor the 34. yeares of Chriſts lyfe befor his aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, be deducted from the firſt of theſe Concils, which was in the yeare after his aſcenſion 1021. and after his Natiuitie 1055: it muſt follow, that euery one of the forſayd ſtipendarie Chaplins, had liued fower ſcore yeares after giuing ſentence againſt Berengarius: becauſe euery one of them is by him affirmed to haue liued at leaſt 1100. after Chriſts aſcenſion; and conſequently they not being Prelats in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils befor their age of 20. yeares, at leaſt; all of them are made to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mownt a 100. yeares. Which ſuerly in ſo great a number of Prelats, had bene a rare grace, and miracle, and a great lykelyhood that God the giuer therof, would recompenſe to the ſight of the world, their zelous imployment, and approue it as moſt laudable. But in deed hondreds in <hi>M. Riders</hi> accompts, are ſome tyme eaſier found a ſtray, then in a pinners ſhopp, at hand.

                     <p>Now I come neerer, to fynde all ſmall vntruethes tending to one Capital vntrueth ouer whelming his whole diſcours, and conuerting all his allegations into a mayne ſea of one falſhood. You haue (as I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> truſt) conſidered often, his aſſurance, and faythfull informations; <hi>that vnder the warmth</hi> (they are his woords) <hi>of Innocentius the third his wyngs, our tranſubſtantiation in the Synod of Lateran was hatched, at leaſt</hi> 1200. <hi>yeares after Chriſts aſcenſion: that the Pixe was inuented by Innocentius the third anno</hi> 1214. <hi>that breefly all our opinion was forged by Innocentius the third.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Vide n. <hi>67.</hi>
                        </note> Here is his fundation for clayming antiquitie. Here is his corner ſtone of the whole frame of his trauayles, that Innocent the third (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoothe) was firſt broacher of our doctrin. All which Babilonian tower by this deuiſion in his owne tong, not vnderſtanding him ſelfe is vndermyned, and vtterly ſubuerted. Some tyme he ſayth perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorily, that Innocentius the third had inuented it; and yet that other Popes had packed iuries, and ſuborned witneſes, to condemne Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garius for being oppoſit therto, aboue a hondred and fourtie yeares befor Innocent the third liued: the firſt condemnation therof being anno 1055. and Innocentius, and the Lateran Concil, but anno 1215. Some tyme that our opinion was neuer knowen nor dreamed of befor Innocent the third; and yet the authoritie of them that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed it, was ſo great, as to ſee all prelats in the world to be ſtipendarie Chaplins, againſt them that denyed it. Theſe are as coherent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:2419:198"/>
as aduiſed reſolutions, as conſtant informations, that were they alone, they ſhould not only perſwade others, but <hi>M. Rider</hi> him ſelfe to be worthye of as great reprehenſion, and confuſion and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, as Ariſto ſuſtained by the Athenians, for vnworthely, and fooliſhly, wryting her commendations. But being conioyned to ſo innumerable of the ſame ſorte, how may he eſcape not to fall into diſperation of being otherwyſe accompted then a <hi>Rider?</hi> You gett not any rethorical apoſtrophes at my hands, to aggrauat this his confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, nor yet any help to gett him vp agayne after this his diſgracefull ſtumbling againſt the head of his owne opinion, during his leaping ſhort at the fownder of our doctrin. But yf you of his profeſsion will aſsiſt him to ryſe. I doubt not by Gods grace to accompagnie him to this iournyes ende, and ſo often to occaſion you to ſupport him in his ſlipprines, as affection could requyre; and yet to renownce him in the ende, as paſt remedie, and recouerie.</p>

One only breefe example is to be at this preſent ſpecifyed. When Lyra, who liued anno 1320. is thought to deny the 6. Chapter of S. Ihon; then is it ſayd, <hi>Ould Lira ſayth, that the</hi> 6. <hi>of Ihon</hi> &amp;c. treateth not of the Sacrament. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwyſe, when we had brought three whole Concils con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning Berengarius, they are excepted againſt, as being late; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though according his owne computation they had bene three hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares elder then Lira. He hath the beſt gift in that, to make ould yong, affirmations negations, diſproofs approbations, truethes falſifications, decrees denials, and to affirme all to be for his purpoſe how aſſuredly ſoeuer he is oppreſſed therby, (lyke Tarleton who affirmed, that his miſtres caſting a chopping knyfe at his head for ſome proffred ſawcines, had done it for a fauour) that lightly may be found, among any wryters of this tyme. Now then for his firſt allegation, and all his inferences thervpon, (although it is not to be graunted, that Magitians, or Sectariſts, can woorke true miracles)
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:2419:200"/>
yf in a liberal diſpoſition I accord vnto them; what is he the better? Let the fayth of ould Rome (the phraſe is ſo pleaſant as it is reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated) condemne miracles done out of the vnitie of the Churche: doth not the fayth of late Rome, as erneſtly condemne them alſo? Doth not S.

Thus much at leaſt we gratefully receaue from our owne S. Auguſtin (who was noe Pope but of <hi>M.

Auguſtins words are againſt vs, that they alwayes ſtyng, and deſtroy them principaly, that diſtort them againſt vs. And when you affirme, theſe woords: <hi>thus much from your owne Pope, &amp; from the ould Churche of Rome;</hi> how aduiſed are you, to denye that the Pope of the ould Churche of Rome, is not our owne Pope? I pray you to ſoder theſe two together: <hi>your owne Pope; not your owne Pope.</hi> Concerning the allegation out of Lira, I am perſwaded as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> much as Lira, that both abuſes may happen, and are to be puniſhed, where, and when they happen. What difficultie then is contayned in his allegation againſt vs? Nether is it other then a Riderian ſequel: ther is an ill abuſe by miracles: therfor no good vſe. Ther is deceit committed in points of deuotion: therfor no deuotion to be followed. For ſo you might proue, that law, phiſick, eating, drinking, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, appareil, preaching, &amp;c. were not to be vſed, becauſe they be ſome tyme abuſed. In the next citation (which by wante of the booke I could not now examen) of the Sacrament, (according to your tranſlation of the altar) and apparences therin by mans pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement, and deuiliſh operation; you take a licence to add to the text the woords, <hi>of the altar:</hi>

Yf your curſing were no better then your diſcourſing, you would as badly deſerue the name of the one, as you are farr (and for all I could vnderſtand, euer was) from obtayning the other. Secondly, do not you ſtart from your word in the 35. number, &amp; in your Reſcript, that as we beleeue to receaue Chriſt realy, ſo you do alſo? yet now, you profeſs that you do not beleeue him to be receaued viſibly, or inuiſibly in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; that yf he be therin viſibly or inuiſibly, it is by legerdemayne?

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> &amp;c. and anſwered it him ſelfe to him ſelfe, ſaying that miracles were graunted to the not beleeuers.<note place="margin">The 198. vntruth.</note> By the 198. vntrueth you add, the woord, <hi>only.</hi> Wherby might follow, yf what was graunted to the not beleeuers, the ſame was graunted only to them: then <hi>M.

                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. <hi>Mar.</hi> 5. <hi>Luc.</hi> 8.</note> yet he changed not their formes. So when he made bread to become his bodye; he changed the ſubſtance of bread, but not the external forme. Contrarywyſe when he was borne, when he walked on the Sea, when he became inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble both at their ſeeking to throw him downe a rock, and to make him king, when he iſſued the ſepulchre, when he entred among his ſhutt vp diſciples, when he aſcended, he altered the natural formes or qualities of his body, but not the ſubſtance therof. Wherby appeareth, that according to his pleaſure, and omnipotencie, he may alter the one without th'other, and as much, and as litle, as it pleaſeth him. As alſo that it is the 200. and it a blaſphemous vntrueth,<note place="margin">The 200. vntruth.</note> that ſuch change was, or is impoſsible, to his diuine maieſtie.

But his text controwleth his gloſſe, by inſinuating that he was, <hi>in portum euectus,</hi> borne into the hauen, and that firſt, not mentioning that he did, or could ſwimme. His ſecond proofe is, that S. Ambroſe or his brother did not conceaue, <hi>diuinum illud fidelium Sacramentum, that diuine Sacrament of the faythfull,</hi> to be Chriſt. What is his reaſon? Becauſe forſooth, it is called <hi>fidei auxilium, a help of fayth,</hi> and not the authour and finiſher. of fayth. O gentle and wyſe exception! S.

Secondly, that had he called it ſo as <hi>M. Rider</hi> wreſteth: what ſequel could be more Riderian, or ridiculous, then that Chriſt might not be the autheur of our fayth, becauſe he is the help of our fayth? Next he ſayth: <hi>Ambroſe calleth it, after,</hi> (according to trueth, it ſhould be ſayd, befor,) <hi>the diuine Sacrament of the faythfull: therfor he thought not as we doe that Christ was localy in the Sacrament.</hi> Was there euer ſuch a therfor?

                     <p>Concerning the copie by me exhibited to M. <hi>Rider,</hi> yow may vnderſtand, that when I peruſed his <hi>Caueat,</hi> and at the firſt ſight, conſidered his ſpirit to ſay any thing for his reputations ſake, and accordingly to auerr the moſt deſperat vntruethes that any bearing contenance of a man, might vttre; I wroote to him the very next daye, in moſt inſtant and intiſing tearmes, that yf he had any cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in his cauſe, he ſhowld procure me one to extract my lucubra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and I would with vnexpected ſpeedines make notoriouſe our ſeueral dealings. He no ſooner requyred it, then it was graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp; withall a warrant to protecte any els that would diſpute with him, and that the printer might publiſh his and my intermedlings. As he confeſſeth, within fifteene dayes, I had diſpatched twelue ſheetes in refutation of his <hi>Caueat,</hi> of which, during his being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, I read parte to him ſelfe, and profered in the place to ſhew the authors them ſelues correſpondent therto. He abſolutly refuſed all examination, and diſputation, (for as both the Conſtable and his owne man <hi>Venables</hi> will not denye, he neuer came at me, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout a couenant, that we ſhowld not conferre in any maters of learning; to which his owne teſtimonie following, accordeth, <hi>that in woords I showld be to hard for a hondred</hi>) requeſting that reciprocatly, we ſhowld communicat our arguments one to another, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyntly imprint them at our ſeueral expenſes. To this I willingly accorded: God doth know, not vpon any preſumption of my ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, but only vpon the aſſurance of the Catholick beleefe. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I being fownded, althowgh being the meaneſt of a thowſand, and as a man of ſtraw, yet in that height was more dredfull to them then any ſcarre-Crow in ane open feelde to the daſtard fowle.</p>
                     <p>After this mutual promiſe, his mynde being trubled with what I had then ſhewed to him, he cowld neuer abyde that I might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioye the vſe of the print, alwayes alleadging, that according to my promiſe he muſt firſt haue peruſed what I would print.</p>
                     <p>By this meanes, retracting his reciprocation to me for equal dealing, it was his ordinarie refuge in all aſſemblies, that I myght print what I liſt, yf I would firſt preſent him with the ſight of my wrytings. So then the 4. of Februarie following in the ſame yeare according to their date (my copie contayning two quyers of paper) hauing firſt kept an extract for my ſelfe, I had another copied out and deliuered to him. Iudge alſo whether it was a reprehenſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laye,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2419:236"/>
to ſpend fower monethes in the making of as much as reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed two quyers of paper, and in re-copying the ſame in as many quyers. All theſe paynes and charges muſt I haue bene at, he hauing vpon me the wringing vye, and following it egerly, that yf I would not ſuſtaine, I ſhowld looſe my game.</p>
                     <p>Now what excuſe thinke you, cowld further be inuented? for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth my copie was not legible. Yet you lately haue ſeene him ſay, that it was, and it was not; it was not, and it was. And after, you ſhall further behowld him aſſuring, that it hath this, and it hath not that; and taking vpon him, to tell many legible points therof. Notwithſtanding, the print was debarred beyond all promiſes: yet therby yf he would ſuffre my trauails to haue paſſed, it both might be legible to his harts deſyre, and he not pointed at for not daring to awnſwer obiections againſt his <hi>Caueat,</hi> vnles he might firſt haue them a tyme, to be well conſidered. Which fowle imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillitie in a profeſſor of learning, his owne maſter in Oxford (at this tyme my deere brother,) M. Sabinus Chamber doth teſtifie to haue bene anciently in M.

I none, and the ſame yeare, he paſſed bacheler and master of Arte, by means of I know not what iuggling, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie. I neuer had any ſcholer more indocile, and vnskillfull.

What packing ther was betwixt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I know, not: but this I know, that he that neuer durſt befor ſtand to their arbitrement, at that tyme ſeemed forward to reſigne his cauſe to their deciſion.

Mayor of the Citie not being ignorant of all circumſtances (althowgh to his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal infamie, a moſt timorous Catholick, as one that moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly knew their impietie, yet for worldly feare, conformed him ſelfe therto) challenged him publickly, of daſtardlines in wounding a man bownd, trampling on one in reſtraint, and triumphing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt one not permitted to reſiſt, by wryting publickly againſt me, who was not allowed to defend my ſelfe: For according to <hi>Seneca</hi> in his prouerbs; <hi>victoria ſine aduerſario breuis est laus: it is a ſeelie and short commendation, to brag of victorie without an aduerſarie.</hi> Or as <hi>Fauſtus</hi> ſome what plainer ſayth: <hi>nil tacito queſita dolo victoria durat; the victorie, obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by treacherie, doth neuer auayle.</hi> M. <hi>Rider</hi> therat, bluſtring into choler, aſſured him, in the publick market, that euen to my face he would confownd me to be guiltie of all tergiuerſation vſed in the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, yf the Mayor would vouchſafe to accompagnie him to the Caſtle. To which motion, the Mayor condiſcended; in the meane tyme inuiting him to diner, leaſt that he would relent, or repent his wounted reſolution.</p>
                     <p>At diner tyme, the Mayor ſent one of his ſergeants, to certifie me diſtinctly of all the forſayd occurents. I aunſwered, (notwith ſtanding my former alienation, for the forſayd ſciſme of the Mayor, not denying but he had otherwyſe euer obliged me,) that I would moſt willingly that ſuch motion, in any caſe, ſhould not be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlipped, but brought to examination. In May, 1604. The Mayor, Iuſtice <hi>Palmer</hi> Captain <hi>Godl,</hi> (the Councelor <hi>Cooke</hi> being within hearing) and others to the numbre (with them of the guarde), of abowt a hondred, ſtanding in the Caſtle cowrt, I was ſumoned by my keeper to appeare. Some litle pauſe ther was, before I came, and ſuddenly M. <hi>Rider</hi> began to glorifie, that he knew I durſt not come. At leinght I came, and inquyred their pleaſure. M. <hi>Rider</hi> declared that he came to haue a promiſed legible copie; or my ſubſcribing to that which I had deliuered; or my going to trial before them of the College.</p>
                     <p>To the firſt of theſe three points, I aunſwered, his owne mowth ſhowld confeſſe the copie to be legible: which I proued in maner premiſed. To the ſecond, that yf I cowld not proue his falſification of my priuat leter, I would ſubſcribe to my whole aunſwer. Which

when I did proue, (as all, or any then preſent will auowch) ſo directly, and perſpicuouſly, as he bluſhed, and they all blamed him for abhominable falſification I tould them, there ſhould neede noe ſuch approbation, conſidering that our iſſue ſhould be not vpon the futur, but euen vpon the Caueat, and my allegations therin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned, in legible print.

Therin, this courſe was houlden. The mayor was requeſted by M. <hi>Rider,</hi> to ſend for it, to the college. He by noe intreatie daring to diſable the opinion of the ſtate; and of himſelfe, inſtructing M. <hi>Rider,</hi> how notoriouſe the cauſe was made alreadie, and how friuolous ſuch ſentence would among all be eſteemed, I nether being in place, nor any bonde of M. <hi>Rider</hi> knowen to abyd the Collegial arbitrement; they not kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing what els to doe with their ſentence, they ſent it freely, and vnwiſhed, to the Mayor, and he to me, with a letter of the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed circumſtances.</p>

                     <p>VVhen I ſaw Maiſter <hi>Fitzſimons</hi> did but <hi>verba dare,</hi> as the chiefeſt point of his profeſſion is, then I vrged him with my laſt letter, wherein I made to him theſe demaunds.</p>

                     <p>Laſtly; If none of the reaſonable premiſſes will be graunted by him, then I deſired him to put his hand to this blotred abortius Scroule, and but ſay it is his owne worke, yet with this neceſſary addition <hi>concordat cum originali,</hi> for without this addition and ſubſcription he might giue me one thing to confute, &amp; deliuer another to his fauourites, and might after my trauails to confute him, denie this ſcroule to be his worke; as now to giue me a legible Copie he would faine denie to be his word: and yet I haue the writing of his owne hand, to witneſſe againſt him the promiſe of his owne mouth.</p>

But let vs debat the mater in ordre. Firſt, they affirme, there was a late ſolemne appeale vnto them befor the right wor. Mayor of Dublin. Ther was I ſay; none ſuch. Only I alone had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſented to goe according to an ancient appeale to the College, giuing to that effect a ring; but my prouoker in publick preſence, repealed to a further licence. Alſo I craue of them, how were they ſolemnely appealed vnto, without forme of appellation? without themſelues, or any for them, to accept our appeale? without bond of both parties, and other requiſit ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, wheras I alone had appealed vnto them, and M. <hi>Rider</hi> euer repealed from them, and neuer entred into bonde to ſtand to their deciſion, he him ſelfe nether in his printed books, not priuat leters mentioning any ſuch appeal, or bonde; and refuſing publickly to giue me any gage of coming to trial befor them; behowld how with faces of a puritanical werniſh, ſuch double appeale, and forged bonde, is fraudulently by them here proteſted! They are now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, to ſhew, ſuch obligation of M. <hi>Rider,</hi> of a true and not falſifyed date, yf any regard of reputation, and ſynceritie, remayne in them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, they affirme, that the caſe reſigned to their deciſion, was of the controuerſie of Tranſubſtantiation, and the conſent of antiquitie in the ſame. Fie vpon all falſhood, what will all the world thinke, when to inferr a partial, and proditorious ſentence, ſuch ſhifting one controuerſie for another, by a reforming deformation, of cownterfet euangeliſts, (to whoſe ſynceritie, the aduerſarie par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, had confidently relyed) is diſfigured? For, as it ſhall ſhortly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, euen by M. <hi>Rider</hi> him ſelfe, we were at noe diuerſitie, for the name of Tranſubſtantiation, but for the ſignification therof. So that to rack the controuerſie, to the name, by none, can be accompted
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:2419:240"/>

Firſt, I haue aunſwered them, abundantly, and ſo litle to his appetite, that I warrant you he had rather ſwallow downe his ould ſuſtenance, the gruell of wiggen, newly from the fyer, then haue had his ſtomach charged therwith. For were he ane Oſtriche, that could diſgeſt iron, and ſteele; yet the mater now requeſted to his digeſtion, is made ſuch an ingredient, or drowg, ſo contrary to nature, and ſo vehemently woorking vpon the ſtomake, that it will burſt the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe, and burne the bowells, yf it may not be inſtantly quitt away by purge, or ſurfett.</p>
                     <p>Read my aunſwer to his preface, and behould, how vntowardly he hath miſtaken all maters; the correcting of an vnknowen booke by a Catholick, from errors inſerted therin by hereticks,) as his owne Author profeſſeth) that, he maketh a blaſphemouſe error of the Popes booke: the Popes reforming vices, and chaſing occaſions of euil; he tearmeth, filthie lyfe, and lewednes, of the Pope, and his Cardinals: the diuers opinions, of the maner of conſecration; he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, to be a flatt denial of conſecration: the affirmation of S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> and <hi>Lira;</hi> he interpreteth to be a negation. And in this laſt point, as in all the reſt, ſo the woords of his concluſion in this place argueth a wyſe and well ſtyled penn-man. <hi>He must</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>mend his aunswer concerning Auguſt. and Lyra, vpon the ſixt of Iohn, or els he is ouerthrowen horſe and foote in deed.</hi> As yf he would ſeeme to ſay, in nothing els I were ouetthrowen; all things els went well; in all other maters my ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw was but fayned, but in this I was forſooth ouerthowne in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de. In dede, M. <hi>Rider,</hi> in dede, this was a iudicial diſcourſe, and a conceit worthie to be regiſtred in a booke of your making.</p>
                     <p>Next, I would willingly be informed, what obligation I had to aunſwer theſe very material points of M. <hi>Riders</hi> preface, he hauing intierly gamboled ouer my Preface, and neuer ſo much as once ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it in paſſing by, but rather with a ſquint regard giuen therto, turned his back toward it. Certainly ſo great reciprocation in me doth preſuppoſe an obligation from him, or els ſome vnknowen inequalitie muſt excuſe.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, in the name of Ieſus, what had ether any, much leſſe all of theſe material points (as he ſpeaketh) to do with all, or any of the articles by him propownded? Let me not be truſted, yf I can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend by what engin, or cable, they may be haled therto. But a tottring religion lyke a giddie dronkard muſt wauer to by maters, whether we will or noe. And let among all other diſgreſſions, this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of <hi>Luther,</hi> which he calleth a fooliſh hereſie (of which a litle

after) teſtifie his ſimplicitie, and ſenſelenſnes in not knowing what is with him, or againſt him. <hi>Luthers opinion of conſubſtantiation</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>is poperie, and was held and mantayned in Rome</hi> 273. <hi>yeares befor Luther was borne.</hi> Firſt, his Author informeth him, that it was not poperie, by confuting it, as opoſit to poperie. 2. That it was taught in Rome, and maintained; his Author telleth not; onely him ſelfe dreamed it. 3. In dede, I fynde, in the firſt booke of <hi>Guitmundus,</hi> and in the 2. tome cap. 43. of <hi>VValdenſis,</hi> that <hi>Berengarius</hi> after his ſecond recantation; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it. But can any be fownd beſyd M. <hi>Rider,</hi> that make <hi>Berengarius</hi> his opinion, Poperie; he being by Pope and Poperie, to the shame of all his fauorits, ſo often condemned, as a ranke heretick?

And when I did abandon it, it was not for any greater temporal preferment, as is knowen publickly by what I then was, and what poſſibilities I had, in reſpect of what I now ame, and do pretend to be. The cauſe of my firſt conuerſion from it, was principaly, becauſe I obſerued the forme of beleefe, called the crede, and the reformed goſpel, to be in all arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles altogether oppoſit one to another. I report me, euen to your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrement therin, after reading my examination of the Proteſtant beleefe toward all the articles of the crede, whether I had miſtaken, or noe. Next, as after I addicted my ſelfe to the diuers controuerſies of both ſydes, examining them curiouſly with their allegations, I was much more confirmed to be a Catholick, by viewing beſyd the crede, all the whole doctrin of Chriſtianitie, from Chriſts tyme he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, to be wholy repugnant to reformations;<note place="margin">Eber in pref. com.

                     <p>When reformations pretended to exclude papiſtrie, (as they te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed rhe Catholick Profeſſion) they alleadged againſt it, that it was forſooth idolatrie, ſuperſtition, magick; that it was a following of Antichriſt, the cupp of the whoore of Babilon, a ſtamp of the beaſt of the Apocalips,  that the ancient Fathers weare pernitious dreamers, doting fooles, idle triflers, fanatical wryters, falſifyers, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prauers, blaſphemers,  as is ſhewed in my firſt preface. Now for their owne authoritie, and warrant to aboliſh papiſtrie, and to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh their reformations, they aſſuredly affirmed the woord of the Lord, Gods booke, and the holy Scriptures, to be their direction; the loue of Chriſt, and his truth, to be their impulſion; the doctrin of the Apoſtles, and their beleefe, to be their intended Reformation. So that, the nick of all their coning conſiſted in fyne fyled and forged diſpraiſes of Papiſtrie, and as curious ſugred deceitfull commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Proteſtantrie approuing them ſelues (as S.

                           <p>In Dona moore, ſeuen myles from Dublin in Irland, M. Richard Bealing Iuſtice of peace dwelled, when Catholicks were perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnder the lord Graye, about the yeare of Chriſt 1580. He being an emine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t perſon, was accuſed (by Syr. R. D. the blind knight, and bloud ſucker) that he harboured one Patrick Nigram a prieſt, euen then to be found in his howſe. Searchers being in all haſt ſent (for at that tyme Iames Fitz Maurice, Doctor Sanders, and diuers others, coming into the contrie, had made the ſtate iealous toward maters of religion) as they inuironed the howſe, the Mother of God, our B. Ladie appeared to Miſtris Bealing, ſaying: se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to Syr. Patrick Nigram, that he diſcend into ſuch a caue, or ſeller, and that remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a ſtone in ſuch a corner, he further diſcend by ſtaires, wher they ſhall conduct him. Which ſhe althoug once, or twiſe admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed

(ſuppoſing it to be a dreame) neglected, till at leinth in viſible maner, with admirable bewtie, and brightnes, the immaculat Quee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of heauen obiected hir ſelfe, and renewed the commandement ſo diſtrictly, that ſhee promptly procured it to be fullfilled. Nigram was a Godly prieſt of vnſpotted lyfe, and rare zeale, my quondam ſchole fellow, whom of purpoſe, I viſited vpon his death bedd, and from him ſelfe, beſyd all others, receaued the aſſurance of this decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. When he remoued the ſtone, he found in dede the degrees, or ſtayres, of fiue, or ſix ſtepps, guiding him to a ſmall neat chamber, of ſome 20. foote long, and 12. foote broad, wherin a bedd, and chaire was duely placed. He being beſtowed in his cabinet, the ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers coming in, with all diligent inquirie, ſought euery place of the howſe, euery ſellar, and corner, but all in vayne. After three dayes, frantick to be fruſtrated, and wearie to inquire without hope of their purpoſe, they departed. Nigram by Miſtris Bealing, being repealed out of his celle (wherin he had all that tyme, abounded with ſpiritual delyte) they couering againe the place, neuer after by any inquirie, were able to fynde ſo much as any ſhew therof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining.

God graunt theſe oppoſitions make the Apologiſt knowen to him ſelfe: for ſuer they detect him to others to be of the deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by Terence: <hi>Imperarunt ipſimet ſibi omnia aſsentari, &amp; principum inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia admirari: quicquid Principes dicant laudare: id ſi negant laudare id quoque.</hi> Such as ſwimme with the ſtreame, and ſway with the tyme: yf Princes would be ſupreme heads of the Church to iuſtifie that their determination: yf they would in ſubſtance ſo remayne, but in ſhew diſclaime to challenge any ſuch prerogatiue, to iuſtifie alſo ſuch diſſimulation.</p>

therby cauſing diuers by deceit, at leaſt in ane indirect, and remote maner, to worſhip them. Which yf they did not, then were they afflicted as diſpiſers not of idols, but of the Emperours.

                           <p>And vpon this confeſſion I ſay firſt to Doctor Couel: it is in dede neere to honor and vertue, ſparingly, and vnwillingly to diſſent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that Church, but a true honor and vertue, had it bene not to diſſent at all. And as by diſſenting in one point, the ſelfe ſame guiltines is incurred, as by diſſenting in all; ſo there remayneth noe other maner to be free from all guiltines, but to conſent againe with that ſame Church, in all Chriſt made it not a piller of trueth, without being altogether ſownd, and free from euery crack. He made not that Church his ſpowſe, withowt exempting it from euery ſpott and wrinkle. He builded not that howſe vpon a rock, not to be permane<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in ſome, but in all trials of ſeaſe, wynds, and rayne. He aſſured it not againſt the infernal gates, but that noe error or force, or fraud of hell,<note place="margin">
